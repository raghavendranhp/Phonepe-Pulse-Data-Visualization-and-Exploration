- **Database:** MySQL, mysql-connector-python
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit, Plotly
- **Domain:** Fintech

## Project Overview
- The Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project aims to extract data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository, transform and process this data, insert it into a MySQL database, and create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. 
- Users can access this dashboard to interact with the data, gaining insights and valuable information about the Fintech domain.

## Key Features
- Extraction of data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
- Data transformation, cleaning, and pre-processing using Python and Pandas.
- Efficient storage and retrieval of data in a MySQL database.
- Creation of an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
- Dynamic data updates on the dashboard based on user selections.
- Multiple dropdown options for users to choose different facts and figures to display.
- Secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution.

## Getting Started
**Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
    git clone https://github.com/raghavendranhp/Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration.git
**Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries and packages.
**Set Up MySQL:** Configure and set up a MySQL database with the necessary tables.
**Run the Dashboard:** Execute the Streamlit app to launch the Phonepe Pulse dashboard.
**Explore the Dashboard:** Access the dashboard via a web browser and start exploring the data.

## Data Extraction
- Data is extracted from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting and is stored in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

## Data Transformation
- Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, is used to manipulate and pre-process the data. 
- This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

## Database Insertion
- The "mysql-connector-python" library in Python is used to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

## Dashboard Creation
- Streamlit and Plotly libraries are used to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. 
- Plotly's built-in geo map functions are used to display the data on a map, while Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

## Data Retrieval
- The "mysql-connector-python" library is used to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. 
- The data in the dataframe is used to update the dashboard dynamically.

## Deployment
- The solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. It has been thoroughly tested and deployed publicly, making it accessible to users.

## Results
- The result of this project is a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner. 
- The dashboard provides at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select various facts and figures for display.
- The data is efficiently stored in a MySQL database and is dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.
- Users can access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. 
- The dashboard provides valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
